# Techni Fees - Membership Fee Management Application

## Introduction

Techni Fees is a Python-based application designed to streamline the process of managing membership fees. This project was created during the early stages of my programming journey, which is reflected in the structure and implementation of the code.

## About the Project

This application was my first serious attempt at solving a real-world problem through programming. As a beginner developer at that time, I approached coding with enthusiasm but limited knowledge of best practices and optimization techniques.

## Technical Reflections

Looking back at this project now, I recognize several areas that could be improved:

- **Code Organization**: The codebase lacks proper structure and contains significant redundancy.
- **Optimization**: Many processes could be made more efficient with better algorithms and data structures.
- **Documentation**: Limited comments and documentation make the code harder to understand and maintain.
- **Error Handling**: Basic implementation of error catching and user feedback mechanisms.
